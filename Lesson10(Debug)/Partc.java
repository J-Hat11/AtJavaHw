/*
 * LetterGrade: 
 * This program is supposed to compute a student's letter grade
 * from multiple quiz scores ranging from 0-100 in value.
 * 
 * Here is the intended behavior (for students to verify with the debugger):
 * 1) Read the student's name.
 * 2) Read in multiple quiz scores as integer values.000
 * 3) Validate that each score is between 0 and 100; if not, force it into this range.
 * 4) If the average >= 60, the student passes.
 * 5) Assign letter grade by average: A >= 90, B >= 80, C >= 70, D >= 60, else F.
 * 6) Print a short summary.
 *
 * NOTE: This file intentionally contains four (4) LOGIC ERRORS for debugging
 * practice.
 * 
 * Use your debugger to find the logic bugs.
 * 
 * When you find a bug, place a comment immediately above the bug and explain
 * what's wrong.
 * Also, comment out the original bug and write code that fixes the problem.
 * Be sure to retest your final program to make sure it works properly.
 * 
 * 
 * Hints:
 * Test the following cases,
         * Scores are 50, 55, 50, 55.
         * Scores are 125, 125, -20, -10.
         * Scores are 70, 80, 90, 100.
         * 
 * For these test cases, 
         * what should the min be? 
         * what should the max be?  
         * what should the average be?
         * should they pass or not?
         * what should their letter grade be?
 *
